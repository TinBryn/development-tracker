Sprint "1" retrospective
========================

Overview
--------
This was trying to get a handle on the technology used and refactoring to make
future changes easier. The issue is I don't have enough understanding of what
changes I need in the future to do so in a clean manner. I've made some progress
nonetheless, but I need to consider usecases more. Overall it was a little too
ambitious for this stage of the project, it's actually hard to evaluate
refactoring when there is little to exploit it. I will try to lower the scope
for the next sprint.

Goals for next sprint
---------------------
Basically to write some HTML and CSS (JS may come later), this will create some
structure to the site which future refactorings will be able to model. Having
some links on the page will also make testing easier. CSS is a low priority,
but I will include it because it will eventually be required and having the
structure already there will be useful.

I will also make a few new routes when doing so. This will stress the
refactorings from the last sprint and give insight into where to go next.

### Todo
1. Add more content to existing pages
   This includes explaining what each page is for and also add some links to
   other pages on the site. This can include pages to not yet implemented pages,
   which will test the full content "Not found" page.

2. Add more pages
   This is to create a page structure, it must have small subsites that each
   have a few pages in them.

3. Styling
   Just some basic stuff will do, have a nav bar, annotate content so that this
   styling applies to it.

4. HTML gen
   I will start with copy and pasting common features of the pages, but when I
   understand how that works I will figure out how to consolodate it. This is
   not expected to be anywhere near completed, maybe just import a common
   navbar and style.

### Long term goals
1. Data storage
2. Auth
3. Pages to add this style of documentation
4. Setting up projects
5. Convienient navigation
6. Github integration?
